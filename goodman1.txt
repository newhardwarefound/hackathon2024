8. Location of the Arbitration Hearing: Unless applicable
law provides otherwise, the arbitration hearing for
United States residents will be conducted in the federal
judicial district in which you reside (in your hometown
area) or, for Canadian residents, in the province in which
you reside, and if you choose, will be in person.
4. Discovery and Other Rights: Discovery and rights to
appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in
a lawsuit. This applies to both you and us. Other rights
that you or we would have in court may not be available
in arbitration. Please read this Arbitration Clause and
consult the rules of the arbitration organizations listed
below for more information.

TO LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND
ANY OF US IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, RATHER
THAN IN ARBITRATION, IF THE DISPUTE MEETS ALL
REQUIREMENTS TO BE HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS
COURT.
6. Governing Law: For residents of the United States,
the procedures and effect of the arbitration will be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et
seq.) rather than by state law concerning arbitration.
For residents of Canada, the procedures and effect
of the arbitration will be governed by the applicable
arbitration law of the province in which you purchased
your unit. The law governing your substantive warranty
rights and other claims will be the law of the state
or province in which your unit was installed. Any
court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the
arbitration award.
7. Rules of the Arbitration: If the amount in controversy
is less than $250,000, the arbitration will be decided
by a single arbitrator. If the amount in controversy
is greater than or equal to $250,000, the arbitration
will be decided by a panel of three arbitrators. The
arbitrator(s) will be chosen pursuant to the rules of the
administering arbitration organization. United States
residents may choose JAMS (1920 Main Street, Ste.
300, Irvine, CA 92614, www.jamsadr.com) or, subject
to our approval, any other arbitration organization.
In addition, Canadian residents may choose the ADR
Institute of Canada (234 Eglinton Ave. East, Suite 405,
Toronto, Ontario, M4P 1K5, www.amic.org). These
organizations' rules can be obtained by contacting
the organization or visiting its website. If the chosen
arbitration organization's rules conflict with this
Arbitration Clause, the provisions of this Arbitration
Clause control. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be
final and binding on all parties.
9.
Costs of the Arbitration: Each party is responsible for its
own attorney, expert, and other costs and fees unless
applicable law requires otherwise. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, and unless applicable law requires
otherwise, if you are a consumer under the JAMS
rules: (a) if you initiate arbitration, Daikin will pay your
share of the costs and fees charged by the arbitration
organization and arbitrator(s) beyond the first $200; and
(b) if Daikin initiates arbitration, Daikin will pay all costs
and fees charged by the arbitration organization and
arbitrator(s).
10. Survival and Enforceability of this Arbitration Clause:
This Arbitration Clause shall survive the expiration or
termination, or any transfer, of the warranty on your
unit. If any part of this Arbitration Clause, except waivers
of class-action rights, is found to be unenforceable
for any reason, the remainder of this clause and the
warranty shall remain enforceable. If, in a case in which
class-action allegations have been made, the waiver of
class-action rights under this warranty is found to be
unenforceable with respect to any part of the dispute,
the parts of the dispute as to which the waiver of class-
action rights have been found unenforceable will be
severed and will proceed in court without reference or
application of this Arbitration Clause. Any remaining
parts will proceed in arbitration.

in a case in which class-action allegations have been
made, the waiver of class-action rights under this
warranty is found to be unenforceable with respect to
any part of the dispute, the parts of the dispute as to
which the waiver of class-action rights have been found
unenforceable will be severed and will proceed in court
without reference or application of this Arbitration
Clause. Any remaining parts will proceed in arbitration.
